<p>I am a versatile guy, that live 27/7 in Linux and Open Source for last 10 years.</p>
<p>Damn good system administrator and naturally grown to achieve DevOps levels and beyond.
I don’t know how guys today can be called DevOps, that not having at least great knowledge in Linux/OS systems. While their work is automating those systems.</p>
<p>Thou, if look at reality, volume of skills I have and knowledge, depth and scale of thinking, some business experience and thinking: must mean I am an architect guy. The person, who understands all fields of technology and was in, have enough experience and knowledge in all directions, that I can reason, be on the same page with programmers in all languages (I programmed in all levels of languages (from Assembly, to C to C++, to Python, JS, Node.JS to Lisp to Haskell)), admins, db-admins, web-developers, hardware engineers, field-support guys, and more-over businessmen and entrepreneurs.
With businessmen we discuss approaches and view, and make solutions even better for them. And in background, most times, I know – that implementations take less time, and have a less cost.
I help businessmen as good as I can. We discuss and do solutions more suitable, with less cost, more robust and more maintainable, and suited for future of their business and it's growth. IT is a strange world, where it is possible in reality. Using masterful approach in several dimensions (technical, management, psychological, social). So I look for great reality-driven clients, really, because that is when we both have best results. I feel accomplished, entrepreneur – happy, and benefits from results. And I like to think they also feel accomplished, and I made valuable fro them part in their business, that get them faster to their dreams becoming reality.</p>
<p>I have great graduate and postgraduate telecommunication education while also had CCNA in Cisco area, love it, and taught it also.
I center to be performant. And build great quality systems.
Automation/virtualization&amp;containerization practice. 
Also I had Microsoft administration history and a touch of love between IBM.</p>

</ul>
<p>For myself I use Linux for everything. Can cover all my needs. I eat my own food 24/7.
In business used *nix in a hosting provider and as system administrator of a systems integrator company for one and a half year. In some side projects, some of them on Upwork. And projects for local business customers.</p>
<p>For servers I use suited to task/requirements distro.
For myself I use ArchLinux, that enables me real great knowledge and understanding of depth and all bleeding edge technologies.</p>

<h4 id="i-know-telecommunications-if-needed-for-work-from-top-to-bottom">I know Telecommunications, if needed for work, from top to bottom</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have higher degree at Telecommunications. Master and underway to Postgraduate degree. Bachelor degree was more software centered (STP modification for PON networks). Master degree more hardware centered (WDM in PON networks). From my interest to hard subject solidly I know software, hardware, and underlying Telecommunication theory, Calculus, Probability theory, Classical electrodynamics that was strong points at my University.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I get official CCNA education. And love Cisco tech and console.
But honestly don't get appropriate certification, and don't saw strong point. On my nevertheless good CCNA knowledge created with team networking lab at university. With complex infrastructure.
Some time after that, my scientific director got contract to conduct courses. I wrote part of the materials, and was main practical knowledge lecturer and held practices for business courses. Courses was created specifically for Ukrainian national broadcasting company and consisted of questions they wanted. From basics of networking, ISO levels 1-3, IP/TCP stack, Cisco and MikroTik basics, basics of switching, VLANs, basic routing &amp; protocols, to basics of encryption, and VPN tunneling, client and site-to-site. This all I explained them in detail. And there was 6 waves of courses.
That is why I have knowledge of networks on something more than Cisco CCNA level because of my Networking education &amp; CCNA courses &amp; some job and science experience of additional and essential topics like multi-area OSPF, MPLS, optical networks.</p>

Than why do you hire professional and give him task. If you give me a task and pay me - it is my responsibility. Rich/effective in live people have only this mindset. And I want both client, friend and me be rich/effective in live.</li>

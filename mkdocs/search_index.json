I got IBM internship, but sadly couldn't be accepted by IBM because University document reasons (finished my degree). IBM staff, like a great company do, in apology gave me 3 basic courses of IBM AIX systems.\n\n\nFreeBSD\n\n\nRedHat\n\n\n\n\nOS Windows\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nStarting from MS DOS 3.0, MS DOS 5.0, Windows 1.0, 3.11, 95, 95 OSR2, 98, 98 SP1, SP2, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 2003 Server, Windows 2008 Server, Windows 2012 Server.\n\n\nI was administrator of system integration company SI BIS, infrastructure was on Microsoft products, this is where my point of Windows 2008 Server, Windows 2012 Server from.\n\n\n\n\nMain technologies I have experience in\n\u00b6\n\n\nInit subsystems:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nSystemd\n\n\nSysV\n\n\nUpstart\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration/Code Management:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nGit\n\n\nSaltStack\n\n\nPuppet\n\n\n\n\nDo Ansible or Chef is not hard for me also, because it is merely a dialects of description for automation.\n\n\nVirtualization & containerization:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nVirtualization and containerization theory\n\n\nDocker (Compose, Machine. Swarm, private repositories)\n\n\nKubernetes\n\n\nKVM\n\n\nVMWare solutions line with ESXi (5.0-5.2)\n\n\nOpenVZ\n\n\nHyperV\n\n\nLXC\n\n\n\n\nDocker is my passion.\n\u00b6\n\n\nDatabases:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nDatabase theory overall. Structure, keys, normalization, queries, transactions, users, rights, boolean algebra.\n\n\nSQL language\n\n\nMySQL\n\n\nMariaDB\n\n\nPostgresSQL\n\n\nInfluxDB (special DB for time-series data)\n\n\nMicrosoft SQL\n\n\nMicrosoft Access\n\n\nBriefly touched NoSQL, MLP databases. Couchbase and MongoDB.\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nZabbix (and it's theory of items, triggers, etc.)\n\n\nGrafana\n\n\nInfluxDB\n\n\nnetdata\n\n\nGraphite\n\n\nSNMP\n\n\nWindows SNMP provider\n\n\nWindows WMI\n\n\nWindows Perf\n\n\nMicrosoft Powershell\n\n\nWindows sysinfo\n\n\nWindows logging and troubleshoot experience\n\n\nLinux Filesystem Hierarchy\n\n\nLinux logging (Syslog, Journald)\n\n\nLinux Finger\n\n\nS.M.A.R.T. (SmartMonTools and so)\n\n\nHardware sensors information\n\n\nZabbix active agents\n\n\n\n\nProgramming & scripting languages \nbasics\n:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nHaskell\n\n\nGo\n\n\nNode.JS (+ Jade, Express.JS)\n\n\nJavaScript (+ jQuerry, CSS, HTML5)\n\n\nBash, Bourne Shell, Dash, Fish, ZSH, Bat files\n\n\nPython (basics)\n\n\nC\n\n\nC++ (basics)\n\n\nQT, QML, QTQuick\n\n\nAssembler (TASM)\n\n\nBASIC (ZX Spectrum, my first PC)\n\n\nVisual Basic\n\n\nPascal\n\n\nLisp\n\n\nC#, .Net\n\n\n\n\nI had a mind inclination to be a mathematician or programmer, but as teen chose not to be. But inclination and experience serve me very well. I can pick up something hard, like Haskell or Assembler, Lisp or whatever and run with it. Use of libraries, frameworks boosts that.\n\n\nVoIP:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nAsterisk\n\n\nNetwork education help me a lot here also\n\n\n\n\nNetwork OS:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nCisco IOS 12.4T, and 15M\n\n\nCisco Catalyst\n\n\nMikroTik RouterBOARD\n\n\nHad brief experience with Huawei VRP to understand how much it is rewritten IOS (but all names are changed). Some technologies also.\n\n\n\n\nI know Telecommunications, if needed for work, from top to bottom\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have higher degree at Telecommunications. Master and underway to Postgraduate degree. Bachelor degree was more software centered (STP modification for PON networks). Master degree more hardware centered (WDM in PON networks). From my interest to hard subject solidly I know software, hardware, and underlying Telecommunication theory, Calculus, Probability theory, Classical electrodynamics that was strong points at my University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI get official CCNA education. And love Cisco tech and console.\nBut honestly don't get appropriate certification, and don't saw strong point. On my nevertheless good CCNA knowledge created with team networking lab at university. With complex infrastructure.\nSome time after that, my scientific director got contract to conduct courses. I wrote part of the materials, and was main practical knowledge lecturer and held practices for business courses. Courses was created specifically for Ukrainian national broadcasting company and consisted of questions they wanted. From basics of networking, ISO levels 1-3, IP/TCP stack, Cisco and MikroTik basics, basics of switching, VLANs, basic routing & protocols, to basics of encryption, and VPN tunneling, client and site-to-site. This all I explained them in detail. And there was 6 waves of courses.\nThat is why I have knowledge of networks on something more than Cisco CCNA level because of my Networking education & CCNA courses & some job and science experience of additional and essential topics like multi-area OSPF, MPLS, optical networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial skills:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nI love smart people\n\n\nI love to work in team if personals are appreciated\n\n\nI love listen to and tell through, it is more fun and productive\n\n\nI love when everyone know their zone of responsibility. I don't like when I get a task, and giver hold my hand or try to do task instead of me. Than why do you hire professional and give him task. If you give me a task and pay me - it is my responsibility. Rich/effective in live people have only this mindset. And I want both client, friend and me be rich/effective in live.\n\n\n\n\nMy GitHub pages\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nGitHub\n\n\nOld GitHub",

I get official CCNA education. And love Cisco tech and console.\nBut honestly don't get appropriate certification, and don't saw strong point. On my nevertheless good CCNA knowledge created with team networking lab at university. With complex infrastructure.\nSome time after that, my scientific director got contract to conduct courses. I wrote part of the materials, and was main practical knowledge lecturer and held practices for business courses. Courses was created specifically for Ukrainian national broadcasting company and consisted of questions they wanted. From basics of networking, ISO levels 1-3, IP/TCP stack, Cisco and MikroTik basics, basics of switching, VLANs, basic routing & protocols, to basics of encryption, and VPN tunneling, client and site-to-site. This all I explained them in detail. And there was 6 waves of courses.\nThat is why I have knowledge of networks on something more than Cisco CCNA level because of my Networking education & CCNA courses & some job and science experience of additional and essential topics like multi-area OSPF, MPLS, optical networks.",

After that next step - recovery - is going to be successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the drive to working system or boot from Live image \nthat is compatible with distribution that you restore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAs I used Arch Linux on that machine, I used Arch based Antergos Live image. DD-t ISO on a flash drive. Antergos image has X11, Desktop Environment and Gparted prettiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall (update) \nlvm2\n and \ntestdisk\n.\nLVM2 as you guess provide LVM support.\nTestDisk is magical but not intuitive tool.\n\n\n\n\nBackup full device\n\u00b6\n\n\nBackup at least what is on the drive:\n\n1\nddrescue -v -f -n /path/to/drive /backup/path /backup/path/rescue.log\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the process is somewhat nontrivial, long and uses a hack in it.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nddrescue\n output \ncan't be archived on the fly\n. If you need compression - use filesystem level compression on the backup media. \n\n\n\n\nChoose right partition table\n\u00b6\n\n\nChoose here right type of the partition. It is up to your research.

Connect the drive to working system or boot from Live image  that is compatible with distribution that you restore.    Example  As I used Arch Linux on that machine, I used Arch based Antergos Live image. DD-t ISO on a flash drive. Antergos image has X11, Desktop Environment and Gparted prettiness.    Install (update)  lvm2  and  testdisk .\nLVM2 as you guess provide LVM support.\nTestDisk is magical but not intuitive tool.",

I wrote part of the materials, and was main practical knowledge lecturer and held practices for business courses. Courses was created specifically for Ukrainian national broadcasting company and consisted of questions they wanted. From basics of networking, ISO levels 1-3, IP/TCP stack, Cisco and MikroTik basics, basics of switching, VLANs, basic routing & protocols, to basics of encryption, and VPN tunneling, client and site-to-site. This all I explained them in detail. And there was 6 waves of courses.\nThat is why I have knowledge of networks on something more than Cisco CCNA level because of my Networking education & CCNA courses & some job and science experience of additional and essential topics like multi-area OSPF, MPLS, optical networks.",
